"""Web search function-tool.

Lets the Realtime assistant look things up online (weather, news, facts, opening
hours, prices, recent events). The Realtime API has NO native web search, and
pipecat 0.0.97 only supports custom *function* tools — so this is wired exactly
like the disconnect tool: a `web_search` function tool whose handler runs a
SECOND, server-side OpenAI call (the Responses API `web_search` built-in tool),
then returns a short, spoken-friendly answer the Realtime model reads aloud.

Uses the add-on's existing OPENAI_API_KEY — no extra account/vendor. Default
model gpt-5.5 gives the best-quality search answers; it's configurable via
WEB_SEARCH_MODEL (the mini/nano models are cheaper) so a different price/quality
(or a renamed model) can be swapped in without a code change.
