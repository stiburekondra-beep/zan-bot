"""Log the conversation transcript (assistant + user) into the add-on log.

WHY: with gpt-realtime the model hears the user's audio natively and bursts the
whole spoken reply as audio — the only window into *what it actually said* used to
be the OpenAI tool-call arguments. This processor surfaces the assistant's spoken
text (and, when input transcription is enabled, the user's transcript) as plain
INFO lines so the add-on log alone explains a turn.

How the text reaches us (verified against pipecat 0.0.97's *real*
`pipecat.services.openai.realtime.llm.OpenAIRealtimeLLMService` — NOT the older
`openai_realtime_beta` module, which pushes different frames):

  - Assistant reply, AUDIO modality (what we use): the service handles
    `response.output_audio_transcript.delta` and pushes a **`TTSTextFrame`** per
    chunk (NOT `LLMTextFrame` — that's only for the text modality). The whole
    response is bracketed by `LLMFullResponseStartFrame` /
    `LLMFullResponseEndFrame`. We accumulate the chunks and log one line on the
    End frame. (We also match `LLMTextFrame` so a text-modality run still logs.)
    These flow DOWNSTREAM out of the service, so the "assistant" tap sits AFTER
    it in the pipeline.

  - User transcript: `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed`
    pushes a `TranscriptionFrame` — but UPSTREAM (toward the input, so the user
    context aggregator can consume it) and ONLY when input transcription is
    configured (main.py: transcription is None unless TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE is
    set). A tap placed AFTER the service never sees it; the "user" tap therefore
    sits BEFORE the service (between the user aggregator and the LLM).

Because the two transcripts travel in opposite directions past the service, no
single position sees both — so the pipeline wires TWO instances of this class,
one per role (see websocket_handler.build_pipeline). It is pure instrumentation:
it never transforms or drops a frame. (Listed for removal under CLAUDE.md
roadmap #5 once the system is stable.)
